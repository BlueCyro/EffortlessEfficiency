# ðŸ‘ŸðŸ’¨ Effortless Efficiency: DIE DIE REFLECTION DIE

Effortless Efficiency is a mod for [Resonite](https://www.Resonite.com) via [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) that aims to provide a continually-expanding patchset for decreasing the amount of repeated reflection used in the engine at runtime, among other upcoming tweaks that may help with momentary hitching or microstutters as well - basically anything I find I can easily optimize.
